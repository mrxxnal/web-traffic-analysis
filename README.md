# web-traffic-analysis

In this project, we dig into web traffic data from the Google Analytics Sample Dataset to get a closer look at how users interact with a website. By following this tutorial, you’ll go through each step of analyzing user behavior and pulling out insights that can help optimize site performance.

Project Outline

	•	Load and Clean the Data: Start with loading up the Google Analytics dataset, then clean it to make sure everything’s ready for analysis.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Dive into the data with EDA to spot patterns, check distributions, and get a feel for the overall user activity on the site.
	•	User Behavior Visualization: Visualize key trends, like pageviews, session duration, and bounce rates, to see what’s working and where users are dropping off.
	•	Actionable Insights: Wrap it all up with insights you can actually use—recommendations to improve web performance based on real data.
